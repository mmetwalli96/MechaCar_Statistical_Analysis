From the figure above:
- The intercept, vehicle_length, and ground_clearance are the parameter that don't have a significant contribution to random amount of variance to the mpg values. In other words, these parameters provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset.
- From the model, the p-value is less than 0.05 which indicates that there is suffecient evidence to reject the null hypothesis and the slop is not zero then, and this is true for couple of variables. 
- This is model is overfitting because there is a lack of significant variables duo to the high significance of the intercept.
