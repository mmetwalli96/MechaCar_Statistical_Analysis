From the figure above:
- The intercept, vehicle_length, and ground_clearance are the parameter that don't have a significant contribution to random amount of variance to the mpg values. In other words, these parameters provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset.
- From the model, the p-value is less than 0.05 which indicates that there is suffecient evidence to reject the null hypothesis and the slop is not zero then, and this is true for couple of variables. 
- This is model is an overfitted because there is a lack of significant variables duo to the high significance of the intercept.

From the above table:
- the variance doesn't exceed 100 in any of the studied cases, hence, the suspension system meets the design specs.

From the above the table: 
- The sample mean is the same as the population mean for all manufacurting lots.
- The sample mean is the same as the population mean for manufacturing lots one and two.
- The sample mean is not the same as the population mean for manufacturing lot three. 

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition
---

- For the statistical study, the success metric that will be used is the mile per gallon (mpg) wich quantifies the fuel consumption rate of the vehichle. It is of a major interest as it used in estimitating the cost of driving the vehicle and the measuring the impact on the environment from running it. 
- The null hypothesis will be if the the MechaCar has the same mpg mean as another manufacturer or not. 
- The two samples t-test will be used to verify the accuracy of the null hypothesis, because, the analytical question that needs to be asnwered is Is there a statistical difference between the distribution means from two samples?
- The needed data are the mpg of no more than 50 vehichles that share similar specs as the MechaCar.
